            .home-faq__card-content
                p Most PA households save between $120-180 per month ($1,440-2,160 annually) by switching from default variable rates to fixed rates. Your exact savings depend on your current usage and provider. For example, PECO customers averaging 1,000 kWh/month typically save $147/month when switching from the default rate ($0.142/kWh) to available fixed rates ($0.079/kWh). Takes 30 seconds to check your specific savings with just your ZIP code.

        .home-faq__card
            button.btn--reset.home-faq__card-btn.js-acc(aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle acc") Is this actually legitimate? Why haven't I heard about this before?
            .home-faq__card-content
                p Yes—PA deregulated energy in 1996, giving you the legal right to choose your supplier. Your utility (PECO, PPL, etc.) still delivers your power and handles outages, but you can buy the actual energy from any licensed supplier. Energy companies don't advertise this because they profit more from default variable rates.

        .home-faq__card
            button.btn--reset.home-faq__card-btn.js-acc(aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle acc") What's the catch? Are there hidden fees or contracts?
            .home-faq__card-content
                p No catch—you're simply exercising your legal right to choose your energy supplier. Fixed-rate plans lock in your price (no surprises), and most have no cancellation fees if you move. The switch happens automatically with no service interruption—same reliable delivery, same company fixing outages, just a lower supply rate on your bill. We show all terms upfront, including any exit fees (most plans have none). You can switch back to your utility's default rate anytime.

            button.btn--reset.home-faq__card-btn.js-acc(aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle acc") How quickly will I see savings, and how long does switching take?
            .home-faq__card-content
                p Switching online takes about 3 minutes. Your new rate starts with your next billing cycle (typically 2-7 days). First month's bill shows immediate savings—if you save $147/month, that's $147 back in your pocket starting month one. Fixed rates lock in for 12, 24, or 36 months, protecting you from the 3-5 price increases that hit variable-rate customers annually. Most people who switch today see their first reduced bill within 10 days.
